1. If the array were sorted using selection sort, what would the array look like after the third pass of the algorithm (i.e., after the third time that the algorithm performs a pass or partial pass through the elements of the array)?

{7, 10, 13, 27, 24, 20, 14, 33}

2. If the array were sorted using insertion sort, what would the array look like after the third iteration of the outer loop of the algorithm?

{7, 13, 14, 27, 24, 20, 10, 33}

3. If the array were sorted using insertion sort, what would the array look like after the fifth iteration of the outer loop of the algorithm?

{7, 13, 14, 20, 24, 27, 10, 33}

4. If the array were sorted using bubble sort, what would the array look like after the second pass of the algorithm?

{7, 13, 14, 20, 10, 24, 27, 33}
