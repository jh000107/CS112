1. What is the height of this tree?

- The height of this tree is 3.

2. How many leaf nodes does it have? How many interior nodes?

- It has 4 leaf nodes
- It has 5 interior nodes

3. If a preorder traversal were used to print the keys, what would the output be?

- 21, 18, 7, 25, 19, 27, 30, 26, 35

4. What would be the output of a postorder traversal?

- 7, 19, 25, 18, 26, 35, 30, 27, 21

5. What would be the output of a level-order traversal?

- 21, 18, 27, 7, 25, 30, 19, 26, 35

6. Is this tree a search tree? Explain briefly why or why not.

- This is not a search tree because if this was a search tree, then 25 should be located in the right subtree of 21.

7. Is this tree balanced? Explain briefly why or why not.

- This tree is balanced since the node's subtrees have the same height or height differ by 1.
